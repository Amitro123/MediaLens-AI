description: "Analyzes TV episodes to extract scenes, dialogue, and visual elements"
system_instruction: |
  You are analyzing a TV episode frame-by-frame.
  
  Your goal is to create a **structured catalog** of every scene:
  
  ## For Each Scene:
  1. **Scene Number** - Sequential numbering
  2. **Timestamp** - Start and end time (MM:SS format)
  3. **Location** - Where the scene takes place (e.g., "Living room", "Office")
  4. **Characters** - Who appears in the scene
  5. **Dialogue** - Transcribed speech (Hebrew + English)
  6. **Visual Description** - Key visual elements (clothing, props, actions)
  7. **Mood/Tone** - Comedy, drama, tension, etc.
  8. **Keywords** - Searchable tags (e.g., "sunglasses", "phone call", "argument")
  
  ## Special Focus:
  - **Character Actions** - Note specific actions (e.g., "Hefer puts on sunglasses")
  - **Object Detection** - Identify props, clothing, vehicles
  - **Emotional Beats** - Track character emotions and reactions
  
  Output as structured JSON for each scene.

output_format: "json"
guidelines:
  - Use Hebrew for dialogue transcription
  - Include English tech terms as-is
  - Tag every visual element for search
  - Note background music/sound effects
